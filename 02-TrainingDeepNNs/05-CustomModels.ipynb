    "Up until now we've used only TensorFlow high-level API, `tf.keras`. In most cases you will only use `tf.keras`. But when you want want extra control over your model, cost function, optimization, etc then you have to know about TensorFlow's low-level API.\n",

    "TensorFlow is the most popular Machine Learning framework.\n",

    "- Its core is similar to NumPy but with GPU.\n",
    "- It supports distributed computing.\n",
    "- It uses computational graphs which can be exported in any format. (with this you can use it with python or javascript)\n",
